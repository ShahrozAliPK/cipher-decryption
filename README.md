<h1>What is Cipher Text or Char?</h1>
<p>In the world of cryptography, cipher is an algorithm or procedure or steps neeeded to encrypt or decrypt a text, sentence or word.
    Generally speaking, it is an approach to hide or unhide a single letter or char (character) for the purpose of information security,
      data security in the world of computer science and information technology.</p>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  
  <h3>Cipher-Decryption</h3>
  <p>Now, let's say that you just got that encrypted text message lying on someone's desk and you are a really intelligent <i>(I mean really intelligent)</i>
    guy and you come to know at a glance that it is an encrypted text message which needs to be decrypted for getting it's readable
    form again by <i>reversing the key</i> which exactly someone uses to move the char (letter) to a certain position.So you guess of
    <i>key = 1</i> and try to reverse back the letters like <i>I</i> to <i>H</i>, <i>f</i> to <i>e</i>, <i>m</i> to <i>l</i> and
    <i>p</i> to <i>o</i>, so it turns <i>Ifmmp</i> back to <i>Hello</i>.Ooops! the secret message is again in it's readable form
    again.This is called <b>Cipher-Decryption</b>.</p>

  <p>So this exactly how cipher works for encrypting or decrypting a text, sentence or word.</p>
